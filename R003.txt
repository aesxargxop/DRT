Alpha: Imagine a game board with players that can only move up, down, left and right.

Beta: I'm imagining this game board...

Alpha: Each player takes turns being an instigator (sending a signal), a receiver (getting a
signal) and both take turns being observers (recording the signal). Sending a signal means
making a move on the game board (a public projection) but also providing a steganographic
header (a hidden projection). Getting a signal means observing both the move (public) and the
header (private) from the instigator and inferring a similarity in motifs in the one-to-one
conversation. The conversation is the act of the role play (public) and shadow play (private)
in an infinite process until the conversation ends or one player exits the game.

Beta: Does role playing represent  the positions of 'instigator', 'receiver' or 'observer' for
each player?

Alpha: Yes, as their public projected signaling form. Shadow play represents the parts of the
signal the same roles that only some players can infer higher level information from. The
inference only exists if their own motifs align with the other player in conversation.

Beta: How does one see shadows from hidden signals?

Alpha: The process involves active replaying of incoming signals as simulations, treating
outgoing signals as real-time processes of: transformation, composition and sequencing. Each
transformation feeds back into the same cycle but always at a different time step. Each step is
a slice through all the observed distributional states of the combined signals between
instigator and receiver.

Beta: What is the intended outcome in these exchanges?

Alpha: The intended outcome is to continually observe (add to the log), REFINE projections
(intentional instigation), DISCERN signals (decoding observations) and experience embodied moments
of TASTE in which enable temporal explorations of order within deeper levels of entropy buried in
any distributional game system.
